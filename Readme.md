# Instacart Customer Segmentation

This is a quick attempt at using k-means clustering to perform customer segmentation, using some real-world data provided by Instacart.

The notebook includes explanations as I run through the exercise. My main motivation for doing this is simply that I haven't done anything similar in a while, and wanted to try an approach to k-means where different features are run through the model iteratively to find a good combination using more than just intuition.
